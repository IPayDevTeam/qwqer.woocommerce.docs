# Warehouses

Warehouse entities may be positioned as pickup points from where QWQER couriers will receive shipments.
You can manage as many warehouses you want.

We understand that your WooCommerce shop may have any plugin for warehouse managing, but we cannot know
which one is in use right now. So for this reason we decide to use our own solution for warehouse managing,
exactly for QWQER needs.


## Managing warehouses

1. You should go to `Warehouses` page inside `Settings > QWQER Settings` page.

3 You may delete warehouse by pressing `Delete` button.


## Creating & Editing

There are required fields that need to be filled in.
- City
- ZIP-Code
- Address

Other fields are optional.

Additionally, there is a switcher `Use as default`, which means that this warehouse will be selected by default on the
shipping order placement model box will be shown.
