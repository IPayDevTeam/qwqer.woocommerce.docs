# Configuration

**Before you can move with the plugin usage, you must configure it!**

You need to provide access credentials of your **QWQER** account and place at least one warehouse.


## Access credentials

To provide credentials you must fill input fields in the special modal window, to open it up you must go to the plugin's settings page.

1. Here we show where is **QWQER** plugin's settings page:

![](../../media/introduction/config-1.png ':class=custom-image')

2. After the modal window will open, please provide all necessary credentials, then set the mode to **enabled**, and press **save**.

![](../../media/introduction/config-2.png ':class=custom-image')


## At least one warehouse

After configuration will be saved, and the modal window close, you will see the module page, please press to the **Add warehouse** to open up
modal window with input fields for a warehouse.

![](../../media/introduction/warehouse.png ':class=custom-image')

After at least one warehouse will be added, you will be able to begin orders shipping via **QWQER** service!

Good luck!
